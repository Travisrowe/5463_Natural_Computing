	1)	Create a set of random binary operator trees which contains only add, subtract, divide, multiply
		as its operators, three variables x, y, and z, and random numbers from 0 - 10
		
	Give a weight to operators so that you end up with more trees that are not just one node
	Also give a limit to trees so that at some point, operators can no longer be selected


enum Class NodeType {opNode, varNode, valNode};
enum Class OperType {add, subtract, multiply, divide};
		
Class ETNode
{
	ETNode * left;
	ETNode * right;
	int val; //int 0 - 10
	NodeType NType;
	OperType op;
	char var; //x, y, z
	
public:
	ETNode() 
	{
		//pick random NType
		//if opNode, pick random OperType
		//else generate random var or val
	}
};

Class BETree
{
	ETNode * root;
	
public:
	BETree() {root = null}
	
	BuildRandTree();
	
	BuildTreeAux(ETNode * r)
	{
		r = new ETNode();
		if(NType = op)
		{
			BuildTree(r->left);
			BuildTree(r->right);
		}
	}
	
	void Print(); //pre-order print
