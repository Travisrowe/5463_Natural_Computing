adjusting direction of ant
	randomize theta in a 180 degree arc (so the ant doesn't step backwards)
		use rotation matrix to adjust velocity
	size of the ant's step does not change, it will always be the width of one cell on the grid
		i.e. the ant changes location by at least one grid square each time
		
class Ant
{
	pair<int, int> loc;
	pair<double, double> vel; //adjusted using a rotation matrix
	int carrying; //number of the object we are carrying 0 - n,
		// -1 if we are not carrying anything
public:
	Ant();
	~Ant();
}
