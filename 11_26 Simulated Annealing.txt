Simulated Annealing (folding metal like in swords)
	Similar to a local search algorithm (hill climbing)
	
	Local Search Algorithms
		Use very little memory
		
Function SA
{
	//initialize T and x (a random starting state)
	E = eval(x) //energy state
	t = 1
	while(not done)
	{
		x' = perturb(x) //get a neighbor
		E' = eval(x') //energy state
		if(E' < E) x = x' //hill climbing
		else
			if(rand()/RAND_MAX < exp((E-E') / T)
				x = x'
		T = beta * T; //beta is a constant < 1
		t++;
	}
	//note that beta is used to reduce T, ie lower the temp
	//As T gets smaller, hill climbing becomes more common
