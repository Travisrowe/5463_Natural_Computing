Test Wednesday
	Study Pseudocodes from the book
		CFO + GSA + Simulated Annealling
		//CFO is deterministic (not random)
		//most other algorithms in this class are stochastic (random)
	Study CFO program where he modifies parameters (velocity, position, acceleeration, etc)

Gravitational Search Algorithm
	F = G * ((M1 * M2) / R^2) //magnitude
	//M1 is mass of object 1, M2 is of object 2, R is the distance between the objects
	//To get the direction of this force, we divide the length of the vector by the 
		//distance between the objects (which gets a vector of length 1). Now we have a force (magnitude)
		//and a direction
		
	Three kinds of masses
		Active gravitational mass Ma
		Passive gravitational mass Mp
		Inertial mass Mi
		
	The gravitational force Fij that acts on mass i by mass j is
		Fij = G * ((Maj * Mpi) / R^2)
		
	Agents update their velocities and positions like this
		Vi(t + 1) = randi * Vi(t) + ai(t)
		Xi(t + 1) = randi * Vi(t) + ai(t) //t is the iteration, so t + 1 just means "new position"
		
	Fitness function and mass are equivalent in this program
	
	Instead of calculating forces for all particles, take the best k objects and calculate forces toward
		those motherfuckers. E.g. 1000 total particles, take the best 50
