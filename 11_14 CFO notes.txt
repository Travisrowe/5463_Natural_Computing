Central Force Optimization (CFO)
	Gravity Heuristic - not an exact simulation of physics
		F = m * a
		in our case, mass is equal to fitness of an object. Objects with higher mass are harder to move
		
		s = s + V[0]t + (1/2) * a * t^2
		except V[0]t is a pain in our case so
		s = s + (1/2) * a * t^2	
		
		Each step of calculating (acceleration and fitness for each node) takes O(N^2) time. N * (N - 1)
		
		CFO is deterministic because it does not use RNG. We can predict what's going to happen.

	In our program, T is actually delta time.
