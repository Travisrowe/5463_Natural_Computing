Exploration - Has an equal probability of bettering or worsening an organism. Mutation is an exploration.
Exploitation - likelihood of bettering your population with each generation. Crossover is an exploitation
    Both of these are necessary in evolution. Exploitation can only get you as good as the local population - "The nearest hill".
    But if there are bigger hills in a different area, then your population will not reach their fullest potential through exploitation alone.
    
    Disruption vs Construction
    Disruption (exploration) is indivual
    Construction (Exploitation) climbs the hills

Subtract the two balls above currBall to determine number of currBall
What top row of balls gets all numbers 1-15 without repeating?

                                                Some methods...
Have to determine what chromosome looks like    [an array with integers 1 through 15]
fitness                                         How many bad balls there are in the end
crossover                                       
mutate                                          Permutation - switching one ball's position with another
