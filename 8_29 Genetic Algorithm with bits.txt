Roulette Wheel Sampling
    Likelihood of organism being selected is his fitness over the total fitness of population
    Give each organism a slice of a pie-wheel equal to his fitness level
    Pie-wheel has nmber of slots equal to total fitness of population
    Pick slot of pie-wheel and whoever owns that slot is picked to mate, therefore, those with large sections of the pie are most likely to be picked.
    
    Let S = Sum of fitness
    Select random real number between 0 and S 
    Loop through your population, adding fitness of each individual until your sum is greater than or equal to S
    Select that individual to mate.
    
Crossover Operator
    One of the simplest ways to crossover is call the single point crossover.
        Select random position for every parent and swap bits from then on
        
    Ex) Parent1) 1100|101
        Parent2) 0110|001   Swap at |
        
        Offspr1) 1100|001
        Offspr2) 0110|101
        
Mutation Operation
    Loop i through chromosome (bits)
    double x = Rand() / (double)Rand_Max
    if x < .01 'low probability of mutating a bit
        flipBit(i)
        
Generations continue until convergence
    Convergence is either you find the fittest organism possible (all 1s in a chromosome) OR you loop through so many generations that you're ready to stop (1000 or so)
    
    Note: Almost all organisms in the final generation are the same or very similar, whether that's good fitness or bad
