Rank selection
    Randomly select two Chromosomes, pick the one with the larger fitness and select it for Reproduction.
    
Prints out every 100 bits for a nice output. just a note.

Elitism
    Find the best chromosome (or the top 5%, 10%, whatever) in every population, then put two copies of that chromosome in next population
    Note: two copies so that you don't have an odd number of Chromosomes in any given population, because that's a little messy.
    
    In Crossover, it is possible that your strongest Chromosome gets crossed (mangled) and the new population suffers for it.

Pool ball
    Pruning method - Start with first ball on the left, put 1. Then second ball put 2. Find out that doesn't work and prune all permutations with (1, 2, ...).
    Then replace second ball with next permutation, 3, keep going until you find that doesn't work. etc.
    
Intermediate blending scheme
    Two real numbers that you can blend, x and y
    z(i) = alpha(x) + (1 - alpha)(y(i)) where 0 <= alpha <= 1
    alpha is picked at random every time
